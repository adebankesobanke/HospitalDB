# HospitalDB
# üè• Hospital Database Project

This SQL project simulates a basic hospital management system. It demonstrates essential relational database skills including schema design, data population, and querying for insights, and is split into two phases as follows:
Phase 1: Schema design and core queries
Phase 2: Advanced database design, ETL pipeline simulation, automation and optimization

Phase 1: Schema Design and Core Queries

## üìå Project Objectives

- Design a normalized relational database for hospital operations
- Create and manage core tables like Patients, Appointments, Doctors, and Treatments
- Extend functionality with Medications, Diagnoses, Medical Visits, and Billing
- Populate tables with sample data using SQL scripts and CSV files
- Perform analytical queries for real-world healthcare scenarios

# üè• HospitalDB: Relational Database & Advanced ETL Simulation Project

A comprehensive, two-phase portfolio project simulating a Hospital Management System. This project showcases relational database design, SQL querying, data automation using stored procedures, and simulated ETL pipelines using Airflow-style logic.

## üìå Project Objectives

This project demonstrates progression from core database design to advanced SQL techniques and data engineering workflows‚Äîideal for roles in data engineering, analytics, and technical product/data management.

### üîπ Phase 1: Core Hospital Database Design

**Goal:** Build a normalized PostgreSQL database with core hospital entities and sample data.

**Objectives:**
- Design normalized tables for:
  - `Doctors`
  - `Patients`
  - `Appointments`
  - `Billings`
  - `Branches`
- Implement primary and foreign key constraints.
- Populate tables with sample data using SQL insert scripts.
- Write exploratory SQL queries for:
  - Hospital revenue tracking
  - Appointment completion rates
  - Branch performance insights
- Demonstrate SQL proficiency and schema modeling.

---
##**Database Enhancement and Business Value**
Database Enhancement: Added views for active doctors, materialized views for branch revenue, age calculations for patients and realistic admission dates
Business Value: Supports rapid operational reporting, ensures data integrity for decision making, and enables analytics on patients demographics and branch revenue performance.

## üß† SQL Skills Demonstrated

1. Database Design & Modeling  
   - Normalized entities into separate tables  
   - Defined `PRIMARY KEY` and `FOREIGN KEY` relationships

2. Data Definition Language (DDL)
   - Created schemas with `CREATE TABLE`  
   - Used constraints (`NOT NULL`, `DEFAULT`, `CHECK`)

3. Data Manipulation Language (DML)
   - Inserted records with `INSERT INTO` scripts  
   - Updated and deleted data as needed

4. Filtering & Querying Data
   - Used `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `BETWEEN`, etc.

5. Joins
   - Combined data across related tables with `LEFT JOIN`

6. Aggregations & Grouping
   - Used `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING`

7. Subqueries 
   - Used nested `SELECT` for filtering and analytics

8. Data Integrity & Constraints 
   - Enforced valid data using relational constraints


## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools Used
- PostgreSQL / MySQL
- Git & GitHub (version control)
- GitHub Desktop


HospitalDB ‚Äì Phase 2: Advanced Database Design & ETL Simulation
üìå Overview

This phase builds on Phase 1, where we designed the foundational schema for the HospitalDB project.
In Phase 2, we move towards enterprise-level optimization and ETL workflows by:

- Caching branch-level revenue summaries with Materialized Views

- Implementing Indexing & Partitioning strategies for performance

- Developing Stored Procedures for ETL-like simulations

- Enforcing Data Quality and Integrity constraints

üîπ Key Objectives

Materialized Views

- Created branch_revenue_summary to pre-compute financial metrics.

- Enables faster reporting across hospital branches.

  Indexes & Partitioning

- Added indexes to improve query performance.

- Partitioned patient/transaction data by branch and time periods for scalability.

Stored Procedures for ETL Simulation

- Automated data transformations (e.g., revenue rollups).

- Prepared foundation for Phase 3 ETL pipeline.

Data Integrity Enhancements

- Constraints and triggers added to ensure clean, consistent data.

üìÇ Files in this Phase

materialized_views.sql

indexes_and_partitions.sql

üöÄ Next Step (Phase 3 Preview)

- Full ETL pipeline simulation with staging tables.

- Integration with BI dashboards (Power BI/Tableau).

- Predictive analytics on hospital KPIs.
